# Chronicles of Ololor

**Chronicles of Ololor** is a small demo of [the original boss fight](https://vk.com/topic-102595219_35730485?post=115) made by **Zapor666** using Blender Game Engine in far 2018. I only rebuilt it in Godot using all his assets from that demo in terms of Godot practice. The original demo and its assets were taken from public recourses.

I also used screen-space outline shader by **Warren Jennings**.

Godot version: **3.5**
